# astro-blog-lab

This repository is an experimental blog project built with Astro.

The main goals are:
- learning static site generation workflows
- exploring blog structure and design
- gradually experimenting with a headless CMS approach

This project may remain incomplete, be restructured, or be abandoned.
That is intentional.

## Concept

- Audience: my future self
- Content style: notes, logs, fragments of thought
- Tone: quiet, minimal, text-focused
- Priority: learning and exploration over completion

The site is designed to work as a static site first.

No framework choice here is considered final.

## Status
